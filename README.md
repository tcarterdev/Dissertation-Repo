This is the artefact to my Dissertation- Paci-Fist

This is the artefact which was submitted alongside my report.
Paci-fist is a game/proof of concept in where you must defeat an opposing clan trying to steal a relic from your clans home,

Pick up and use items you find within the game world to defeat the Black Nirvana and get to the Boss Shrine.

This utilizes a procedural dungeon generator, unique shooting mechanics and the new unity input system. (KBM+CONTROLLER)
