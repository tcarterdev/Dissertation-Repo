# Dissertation-Repo
This is the artefact to my Dissertation; "Maximising Financial Success as an Indie Developer" titled Paci-Fist.
This dissertation explores different publishing options available for an indie developer in the modern day. An analysis and comparison was done between the ones available in 2023.
A market research into what was popular to capitalise of current trends was done. From the results, a game was then made geared towards what is popular.

This is the artefact which was submitted alongside my report.
Paci-fist is a game/proof of concept in where you must defeat an opposing clan trying to steal a relic from your clans home,

Pick up and use items you find within the game world to defeat the Black Nirvana and get to the Boss Shrine.

This utilizes a procedural dungeon generator, unique shooting mechanics and the new unity input system. (KBM+CONTROLLER)
